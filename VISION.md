# Vision

We deliver production-grade systems with:
- Full implementations (no placeholders)
- Deterministic behaviour and reproducible builds
- Strong typing, explicit invariants, thorough tests
- Security & privacy by default (least privilege)
- Observability (logs/metrics/traces) in critical paths

Anti-drift: Any decision must trace to this document or an approved design note linked from OVERVIEW.md.
